Your product works. Early customers prove it. But revenue isn't scaling.

You're not ready for a full-time CRO—or you tried a sales hire and it failed. You need someone who understands what you built before they try to sell it.

I go deep on your product, market, and early wins. Then I build the playbook that fits—positioning, process, pipeline. I join calls, pressure-test deals, and help you close. When you're ready to hire, I help you find the right person.

{{< testimonial name="Steve Myers" title="President, Bitcoin Dev Kit Foundation" >}}
Shawn's expertise in Bitcoin business strategy has been crucial in developing BDK's outreach. As a developer, I struggle with project promotion, but Shawn helped me identify and communicate our value effectively. I highly recommend Shawn to anyone starting or growing a Bitcoin project.

{{< section-label "Background" >}}

I've generated over $300M in revenue across three decades—starting on Microsoft's first browser team, then commercializing early internet infrastructure at Exodus, IoT hardware at ANKR, personal data sovereignty at Dataswift, and Bitcoin payments at Bottlepay, NYDIG, and Amboss.

Technical enough to go deep. Commercial enough to close.
