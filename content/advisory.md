<h2 class="landing-section-label">The Situation</h2>
<p>You've got your sales motion figured out—at least the basics. Now you need someone in your corner as you scale. A strategic partner who knows the terrain, can spot problems early, and helps you navigate the hard decisions.</p>
<p>That's what the advisory relationship is for.</p>
</section>

<section class="landing-section">
<h2 class="landing-section-label">What's Included</h2>
<ul>
<li>Weekly sessions (60 minutes)</li>
<li>Deal reviews and pipeline strategy</li>
<li>Async access for quick questions</li>
<li>Live call backup when you need another voice in the room</li>
<li>Hiring support—sales hire profiles, interview frameworks, onboarding guidance</li>
<li>Ongoing positioning and messaging refinement</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="landing-section">
<h2 class="landing-section-label">How It Works</h2>
<p>We meet weekly. You bring the deals, the challenges, the strategic questions. I bring the pattern recognition, the frameworks, and the direct feedback you need.</p>
<p>When a big deal needs another voice, I join the call. When you're hiring, I help you define the role and evaluate candidates. When the market shifts, we adjust the playbook.</p>
<p>Month-to-month commitment. No long-term contracts.</p>
</section>

<section class="landing-section">
<h2 class="landing-section-label">Who This Is For</h2>
<p>Founders who've done the initial work—you have a sales process, you're closing deals, but you want experienced guidance as you scale. You value having someone who's seen these problems before and can help you avoid the mistakes.</p>
<p>Often a good fit after completing a 90-Day Sprint, or for founders who've already figured out the basics on their own.</p>
</section>

<section class="landing-section">
<h2 class="landing-section-label">Next Step</h2>
<p>Book a call to discuss your situation. We'll figure out if ongoing advisory is the right fit, or if a Sprint makes more sense first.</p>
