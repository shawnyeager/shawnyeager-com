  - label: "The Situation"
    paragraphs:
      - "You've got your sales motion figured out—at least the basics. Now you need someone in your corner as you scale. A strategic partner who knows the terrain, can spot problems early, and helps you navigate the hard decisions."
      - "That's what the advisory relationship is for."

  - label: "What's Included"
    list:
      - "Weekly sessions (60 minutes)"
      - "Deal reviews and pipeline strategy"
      - "Async access for quick questions"
      - "Live call backup when you need another voice in the room"
      - "Hiring support—sales hire profiles, interview frameworks, onboarding guidance"
      - "Ongoing positioning and messaging refinement"

  - label: "How It Works"
    paragraphs:
      - "We meet weekly. You bring the deals, the challenges, the strategic questions. I bring the pattern recognition, the frameworks, and the direct feedback you need."
      - "When a big deal needs another voice, I join the call. When you're hiring, I help you define the role and evaluate candidates. When the market shifts, we adjust the playbook."
      - "Month-to-month commitment. No long-term contracts."

  - label: "Who This Is For"
    paragraphs:
      - "Founders who've done the initial work—you have a sales process, you're closing deals, but you want experienced guidance as you scale. You value having someone who's seen these problems before and can help you avoid the mistakes."
      - "Often a good fit after completing a 90-Day Sprint, or for founders who've already figured out the basics on their own."
