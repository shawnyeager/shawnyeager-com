<h2 class="landing-section-label">The Situation</h2>
<p>You don't need someone in the weeds with you every week. You need a strategic sounding board—someone who's been there, understands frontier tech, and can help you think through the hard questions.</p>
<p>Coaching gives you that access without the commitment of deeper advisory work.</p>
</section>

<section class="landing-section">
<h2 class="landing-section-label">What's Included</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bi-weekly calls (45 minutes)</li>
<li>Async access for quick questions between calls</li>
<li>Positioning and messaging feedback</li>
<li>Strategic guidance on sales challenges</li>
<li>Pattern recognition from 30 years of GTM experience</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="landing-section">
<h2 class="landing-section-label">How It Works</h2>
<p>We meet every two weeks. You bring whatever's on your mind—a deal that's stuck, a messaging question, a strategic decision you're wrestling with. I bring perspective and direct feedback.</p>
<p>Between calls, you can reach out async when something urgent comes up. Not for deep work, but for quick input when you need it.</p>
<p>Month-to-month commitment. Upgrade to full advisory or a Sprint anytime.</p>
</section>

<section class="landing-section">
<h2 class="landing-section-label">Who This Is For</h2>
<p>Early-stage founders who are still doing most of the selling themselves. You're figuring things out, but you want experienced input along the way. You're not ready for deep engagement, but you value having someone to call.</p>
<p>Also a good fit for founders who've completed a Sprint and want lighter ongoing support.</p>
