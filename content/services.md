## Who I Work With

Your product works and early customers prove it, but revenue isn't scaling.

You're post-seed or Series A. You're not ready for a full-time CRO, or you tried a sales hire and it failed. You need someone who understands what you built before they try to sell it.

## How I Work

I go deep on your product, your market, and your early wins. Then we build the sales motion that fits—positioning, process, messaging, pipeline.

I get in the work with you. I join customer discovery calls, pressure-test deal strategy, and review pipeline. I help you close. When you're ready to hire, I help you find the right person and set them up to succeed.

You stay in control. I make sure you're pointed in the right direction until it's working.

## Services

### 90-Day Revenue Sprint

Three months to get your sales motion working. $20,000–$30,000 total.

**Month 1: Clarity**
- Deep dive on product, market, and early wins
- Customer discovery calls (I'm on them with you)
- Positioning and messaging locked down
- Ideal customer profile defined

**Month 2: Focus**
- Sales process documented
- Outreach and pipeline strategy
- Pricing and packaging reviewed
- First deals in motion

**Month 3: Momentum**
- Pipeline building and deal coaching
- Sales hire profile defined (if needed)
- Playbook handed off
- Transition plan to next phase

### Monthly Advisory

Ongoing strategy and deal support. $7,500–$12,000/month.

- Weekly sessions
- Deal reviews and pipeline pressure-testing
- Live support on key calls

*Best fit: Post-sprint, or founders with GTM basics who need a sparring partner.*

### Founder Coaching

Guidance without the full engagement. $3,500–$6,000/month.

- Bi-weekly calls
- Async access for deal questions
- Positioning and messaging feedback

*Best fit: Seed founders not ready for a sprint but need experienced eyes on what they're building.*

## Why Me

30 years commercializing products the market didn't understand yet. $300M in revenue across companies including Microsoft, Exodus, NYDIG, and Amboss.

I started on Microsoft's first browser team. I built $180M in partner revenue at Exodus when internet infrastructure was new. I scaled an IoT startup into Best Buy and Home Depot. I took Dataswift from zero to $3.25M pipeline in nine months. Since 2021, I've led sales for Bitcoin infrastructure companies including NYDIG, Bottlepay, and Amboss.

Technical enough to go deep. Commercial enough to close.

I don't bring a playbook. I build the one that fits.

- Helped AI infra startup hit $1M ARR in 6 months.
- Guided Bitcoin protocol team to $500k first-quarter revenue.
