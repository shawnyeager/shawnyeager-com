## Trust Revolution podcast

I'm currently hosting Trust Revolution, where I explore how we can rethink trust for a decentralized future. Recent episodes have covered digital ID regimes, how supranational compliance bodies project global financial control, and building open communities on open protocols. Working on conversations about private Bitcoin payments as an expression of the Bill of Rights and the historical foundations of trust.

## Advisory & operating work

Working with several Bitcoin and freedom tech startups on go-to-market strategy and revenue. Focused on helping teams move from product-market fit to scalable revenue models. Current themes: enterprise sales cycles for Bitcoin infrastructure, partnership strategy, and building revenue teams in Bitcoin.

## Writing

Publishing one essay per month on Bitcoin go-to-market, partnerships, and revenue leadership. Current topics I'm exploring:

- Why traditional SaaS playbooks don't work for Bitcoin
- Building trust in sales when selling "trustless" systems
- The unique challenges of revenue leadership in Bitcoin

## Learning & thinking about

- How Bitcoin changes the fundamentals of go-to-market strategy
- The role of education in Bitcoin enterprise sales
- Building sustainable revenue models for open-source Bitcoin projects
- Decentralized identity and its implications for trust systems
