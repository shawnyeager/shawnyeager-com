### Trust Revolution Podcast

I'm currently hosting Trust Revolution, where I explore how we can rethink trust for a decentralized future. Recent episodes have covered the Lightning Network's role in scaling Bitcoin, institutional adoption challenges, and the evolution of self-custody solutions. Working on conversations about Bitcoin's role in emerging markets and the intersection of AI and decentralized systems.

### Advisory & Operating Work

Working with several Bitcoin startups on go-to-market strategy and revenue operations. Focused on helping teams move from product-market fit to scalable revenue models. Current themes: enterprise sales cycles for Bitcoin infrastructure, partnership strategy for Lightning companies, and building revenue teams in Bitcoin.

### Learning & Thinking About

- How Bitcoin changes the fundamentals of go-to-market strategy
