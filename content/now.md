## Themes

**UX versus sovereignty:** How do you balance commercially desirable solutions (often custodial) with enabling true self-sovereignty? Most users choose convenience. Freedom tech needs to remove that forced choice.

**Timing the revenue engine:** When do you shift from founder-led selling to building scalable revenue systems in Bitcoin companies? Particularly when negative price action affects customer faith and interest.

**Developer-first versus customer-first:** Most Bitcoin infrastructure starts developer-focused. When and how do you make the jump to end-customer go-to-market without losing technical credibility or creating channel conflict?

## Advisory & operating work

Working with Bitcoin and freedom tech startups through fractional roles, project-based consulting, and advisory. Current work includes go-to-market strategy for new freedom tech services, channel sales frameworks, and proof-of-concept programs for enterprise adoption. The goal: compete commercially so freedom tech wins on distribution and user experience, not just technology.
