## Themes

**UX versus sovereignty:** How do you balance commercially desirable solutions (often custodial) with enabling true self-sovereignty? Most users choose convenience. We need to remove that forced choice.

**Timing the revenue engine:** When do you shift from founder-led selling to building scalable revenue systems in Bitcoin companies? Particularly when negative price action affects customer faith and interest.

**Developer-first versus customer-first:** Most Bitcoin infrastructure starts developer-focused. When and how do you make the jump to end-customer go-to-market without losing technical credibility or creating channel conflict?

## Writing & building

Publishing monthly [essays](/essays/) on how frontier tech wins---sales, partnerships, and product. Thinking in public at [notes.shawnyeager.com](https://notes.shawnyeager.com).

New projects:

- [GTM Map](https://gtm.shawnyeager.com) --- Plot your go-to-market readiness across foundation, growth, and monetization---from market clarity to retention. Answer the go-to-market questions that come after product-market fit.

- [Hearsay](https://github.com/shawnyeager/hearsay) --- Feed customer interview transcripts to an LLM pipeline and get frequency-ranked problems, solution desires, and concrete build recommendations. An expansion of the Interview to Roadmap Kit with improved analysis and output formats.

## Trust Revolution podcast

Season 3 begins recording next week. Previous seasons explored decentralized reputation, Bitcoin as human rights infrastructure, and why voluntary payment struggles against ads. New season continues the conversation on how trust systems shape freedom tech adoption.

## Advisory & operating work

Working with founders through fractional roles, project-based consulting, and advisory. Current work includes go-to-market strategy, channel sales frameworks, and proof-of-concept programs for enterprise adoption. The goal: compete commercially so frontier tech wins on distribution and user experience, not just technology.
