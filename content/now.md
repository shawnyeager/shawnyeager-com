## Themes

**UX versus sovereignty:** How do you balance commercially desirable solutions (often custodial) with enabling true self-sovereignty? Most users choose convenience. Freedom tech needs to remove that forced choice.

**Timing the revenue engine:** When do you shift from founder-led selling to building scalable revenue systems in Bitcoin companies? Particularly when negative price action affects customer faith and interest.

**Developer-first versus customer-first:** Most Bitcoin infrastructure starts developer-focused. When and how do you make the jump to end-customer go-to-market without losing technical credibility or creating channel conflict?

## Writing & building

Publishing monthly [essays](/essays/) on how freedom tech wins---sales, partnerships, and product. Thinking in public at [notes.shawnyeager.com](https://notes.shawnyeager.com).

New projects:

- [Sales Readiness Score](/score) --- A 10-question GTM diagnostic for B2B founders. Answer questions across market clarity, positioning, sales process, acquisition, and unit economics. Get a score out of 100 and optional personalized follow-up.

- [Interview to Roadmap Kit](https://github.com/shawnyeager/interview-to-roadmap) --- Point an LLM at a folder of customer interview transcripts and get frequency-ranked problems, solution desires, and concrete build recommendations. Answers: "What should we build next, and why?"

## Trust Revolution podcast

## Advisory & operating work

Working with Bitcoin and freedom tech startups through fractional roles, project-based consulting, and advisory. Current work includes go-to-market strategy for new freedom tech services, channel sales frameworks, and proof-of-concept programs for enterprise adoption. The goal: compete commercially so freedom tech wins on distribution and user experience, not just technology.
