    paragraphs:
      - "You've got a product that works. Early customers prove it. But revenue isn't scaling the way it should."
      - "Maybe you hired a salesperson and it didn't work out. Maybe you're still doing all the selling yourself and can't figure out how to hand it off. Maybe you just don't know what's broken."
      - "The Sprint fixes that."

  - label: "How It Works"
    paragraphs:
      - "<strong>Month 1: Clarity</strong>"
      - "We get aligned on who you're selling to and why they buy. Positioning, ICP definition, messaging that resonates. By the end of month one, you'll know exactly what you're selling and to whom."
      - "<strong>Month 2: Focus</strong>"
      - "We build the sales process. Qualification criteria, pipeline stages, objection handling. I join customer calls with you. We figure out what works and codify it."
      - "<strong>Month 3: Momentum</strong>"
      - "We close deals together. Pipeline review, deal strategy, coaching on live opportunities. By the end, you have a repeatable motion you can run—or hand off to a hire."

  - label: "What's Included"
    list:
      - "Weekly working sessions (90 minutes)"

  - label: "Who This Is For"
    paragraphs:
      - "Post-seed or Series A founders with a working product and some early revenue. You're selling into enterprise or mid-market. You're building in frontier tech—Bitcoin, AI, decentralized infrastructure, open source."
      - "You're not ready for a full-time CRO, but you need someone who's done this before."
