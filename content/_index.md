I fix revenue engines for founders building on it---strong products that aren't scaling. Positioning, sales process, pipeline. The stuff that turns a good product into a growing company.

30 years in tech, $300M in revenue. Led sales at Amboss, NYDIG Payments, and Bottlepay.

Products win in the market---or not at all. {{< cta url="/lets-win" text="Let's win" event="lets_win_cta" >}}
