Over 30 years, I've worked on technology that increases human freedom, creating more than $300M in revenue---most recently leading sales and partnerships at Amboss, NYDIG Payments, and Bottlepay. Now I help freedom tech companies compete and win commercially.

Surveillance-based platforms dominate on distribution and user experience. Freedom tech wins by being undeniably better at both.
