I help founders on the same mission solve hard commercial problems---positioning, pricing, sales, pipeline. The stuff that turns a good product into a growing company.

30 years in tech, $300M in revenue. Led sales at Amboss, NYDIG Payments, and Bottlepay.

Freedom tech wins in the market---or not at all. {{< cta url="/lets-win" text="Let's win" event="lets_win_cta" >}}
