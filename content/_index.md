I've built my career around technology that increases human freedom. Over 30 years, that work has created more than $300M in revenue. Most recently, I led sales and partnerships at Amboss Technologies, NYDIG Payments, and Bottlepay. Now I help Bitcoin and freedom tech startups compete and win commercially.

Surveillance Economy platforms own distribution and user experience. Freedom tech wins by being better at both.
