I've built my career around technology that increases human freedom. Over 30 years, that work has created more than $300M in revenue. Most recently, I led sales and partnerships at Amboss Technologies, NYDIG Payments, and Bottlepay.

Today I help Bitcoin and freedom tech startups compete and win commercially. Surveillance Economy platforms dominate distribution and user experience. Freedom tech will win by being better at both.
