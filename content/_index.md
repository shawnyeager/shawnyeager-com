I've built my career around technology that increases human freedom. Over 30 years, that work created more than $300M in revenue---including leading sales and partnerships at Amboss Technologies, NYDIG Payments, and Bottlepay.

Now I help Bitcoin and freedom tech startups compete against Surveillance Economy platforms that own distribution and user experience. Freedom tech wins by being better at both.
