## Extended bio (~150 words)

{{< card class="bio-text" >}}
Shawn Yeager helps Bitcoin and freedom tech startups compete and win commercially against Surveillance Economy platforms. Over 30 years, he's created more than $300M in revenue---most recently leading sales and partnerships at Amboss Technologies (Lightning Network infrastructure), NYDIG Payments (institutional Bitcoin services), and Bottlepay (Lightning payments).

He helps Bitcoin and freedom tech founders win commercially---as an advisor and operator on product-market fit, go-to-market, and revenue. He hosts Trust Revolution, a podcast exploring how Bitcoin and decentralized technologies are reshaping trust, sovereignty, and freedom. His writing on Bitcoin strategy, go-to-market, and building for the long term appears at shawnyeager.com.

His work is guided by a belief that Surveillance Economy platforms own distribution and user experience---and that freedom tech wins by being undeniably better at both.
