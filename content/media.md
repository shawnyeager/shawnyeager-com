## Extended bio (150 words)

{{< card class="bio-text" >}}
Shawn Yeager helps Bitcoin and freedom tech startups compete and win commercially against Surveillance Economy platforms. He's built his career on technology that increases human freedom. Over 30 years, that work has generated more than $300M in revenue.

Shawn specializes in revenue operations, strategic partnerships, and enterprise sales. Most recently, he led sales and partnerships at Amboss Technologies (Lightning Network infrastructure), NYDIG Payments (institutional Bitcoin services), and Bottlepay (Lightning payments).

Shawn hosts Trust Revolution, a podcast exploring how Bitcoin and decentralized technologies are reshaping trust, sovereignty, and freedom. His writing on Bitcoin strategy, go-to-market, and building for the long term appears at shawnyeager.com.

His work is guided by a belief that Surveillance Economy platforms own distribution and user experience---and that freedom tech wins by being undeniably better at both.

Trust Revolution is a podcast exploring how we can rethink trust for a decentralized future. Through conversations with builders, thinkers, and operators in Bitcoin and beyond, we examine the systems we trust, why they work (or don't), and what comes next.
