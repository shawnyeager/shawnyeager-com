## Extended bio (~150 words)

{{< card class="bio-text" >}}
Shawn Yeager is working toward a future built on Bitcoin. He operates, advises, and invests in startups building it.

Over 30 years, he's driven more than $300M in revenue---from browsers to Bitcoin. Most recently, he led sales and partnerships at Amboss Technologies (Lightning Network infrastructure), NYDIG Payments (institutional Bitcoin services), and Bottlepay (Lightning payments).

Now he helps founders solve hard commercial problems: positioning, sales process, partnerships, revenue---the stuff that turns a good product into a growing company.

He hosts Trust Revolution, a podcast exploring how Bitcoin and decentralized technologies are reshaping trust, sovereignty, and freedom. His writing appears at shawnyeager.com.
