### Extended Bio (150 words)

{{< card class="bio-text" >}}
Shawn Yeager helps freedom-focused technology companies compete and win commercially against surveillance-based platforms. Over 30 years, he's worked on technology that increases human freedom, creating more than $300M in revenue.

Shawn specializes in revenue operations, strategic partnerships, and enterprise sales. Most recently, he led sales and partnerships at Amboss (Lightning Network infrastructure), NYDIG Payments (institutional Bitcoin services), and Bottlepay (Lightning payments).

Shawn hosts Trust Revolution, a podcast exploring how Bitcoin and decentralized technologies are reshaping trust, sovereignty, and freedom. His writing on Bitcoin strategy, go-to-market, and building for the long term appears at shawnyeager.com.

His work is guided by a belief that surveillance-based platforms dominate on distribution and user experience---and that freedom tech wins by being undeniably better at both.
