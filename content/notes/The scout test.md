# The scout test

BANT misses the thing that kills deals.

Budget, authority, need, timeline—these filter on circumstances. They're good filters. A buyer with no budget can't buy, and a buyer with no authority can't sign. Getting this wrong wastes months. But you can have a BANT-qualified buyer and still lose three months of your life to a deal that was never open. All the circumstances present, the decision already made. The missing qualifier is mindset.

## Two types on every discovery call

There are two types of buyers on discovery calls, and the difference is visible in the first fifteen minutes if you know what you're watching.

One type is trying to figure out whether this fits. They ask real questions—not the objection-dressed-as-a-question kind, but questions that could actually change their assessment. They tell you when something doesn't fit, because they'd rather know now than after three months of evaluation. When you say something unexpected, they incorporate it. They're building a picture.

The other type arrived with a conclusion forming. They're going through the motions of evaluation—demos, reference calls, procurement steps—but the outcome is largely set. Every new piece of information gets sorted by a single criterion: does this support or threaten what I already think? Objections show up before they've heard enough to have real objections. The call has the shape of discovery without the substance. Shawn's essay on [soldiers and scouts](https://shawnyeager.com/limits-of-persuasion/) covers this frame in depth. The point here is narrower: it shows up on every B2B discovery call, and most salespeople don't qualify for it.

## The question that surfaces it

The expensive mistake is spending three months on a soldier. They'll book the follow-ups, send you through procurement, request references, ask detailed questions about implementation. All the signals of an active deal. But the decision was never open—they were building ammunition for "no," or satisfying their boss that alternatives were evaluated. You find out at the end. You rarely see it at the start.

One question surfaces it early: what would it take to be a yes?

A scout gives you something specific. Here's what we need to see. Here's the timeline. Here's who has to sign off. You can test every element of that and know where you stand. A soldier deflects or pivots to another objection. Or gives you an answer that, on inspection, is a moving target—satisfied, and a new condition appears. That's not a buyer working through concerns. That's a buyer who isn't actually evaluating.

## What BANT doesn't catch

BANT doesn't catch this because circumstances and mindset are independent. Someone can have the budget, the authority, the need, and the timeline—and still not be genuinely deciding. The question "can they buy?" is different from "are they actually deciding?"

The scout test asks the second question. You can't convert soldiers by being more persuasive—mindset isn't a closing problem. What you can do is identify it faster and move on. The scouts are in your pipeline. So are the soldiers. The difference between a good quarter and a wasted one is mostly which ones you spend time on.
