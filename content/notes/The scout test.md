description: Applying Julia Galef's scout vs. soldier framework to discovery calls reveals which buyers are genuinely evaluating and which were never going to close.
---

You can tell in the first fifteen minutes.

Not always who will close. But who is worth your time.

Julia Galef's scout and soldier frames are usually applied to belief formation—how people handle information that challenges what they already think. Scouts update. Soldiers defend. One is trying to see clearly; the other is trying to win.

The same split shows up on every discovery call you run.

## What scouts look like on a call

Scouts ask real questions. Not the rhetorical kind, not the objection-dressed-as-question kind—actual questions. They want to understand how the product works, whether it fits their situation, what the failure modes are. When you say something surprising, they lean in instead of deflecting.

They'll tell you when something doesn't fit. Scouts self-qualify because they're actually trying to figure out whether this is the right solution. If it isn't, they want to know now, not after three months of evaluation. That honesty makes discovery faster and more accurate.

They update during the call. You explain something and they incorporate it. Their next question reflects what you just said. They're building a picture of whether this works, not defending a position they arrived with.

## What soldiers look like on a call

Soldiers come in with a verdict already forming. They're going through the motions of evaluation, but the outcome is largely set. Every piece of information becomes either evidence for their existing position or a threat to it.

Objections arrive before they've heard enough to have real objections. "We tried something like this before and it didn't work" before they've seen what makes yours different. "Our team won't adopt new tools" before they've asked how the tool gets deployed. These aren't objections from evidence. They're defenses from identity.

Soldiers don't ask questions that might change their mind. They ask questions that let them explain why they're skeptical. The conversation has the shape of discovery without the substance.

## The costly tell

The expensive version of this mistake: spending three months working a soldier.

They attend the demos. They ask for references. They send you through procurement. They schedule follow-up calls. They generate all the signals of an active deal. But the decision was never really open. They were gathering ammunition for "no" or hedging against their boss asking why they didn't evaluate alternatives.

The pipeline looked real. The deal wasn't.

You learn this after. You rarely ask the question that would surface it early: "What would it take to be a yes?"

Scouts give you something specific and useful—here's what we'd need to see, here's the timeline, here's who signs off. Soldiers give you something vague or pivot to another objection.

That question is cheap to ask. Three months of follow-up is expensive to lose.

## Where the energy goes

Selling to soldiers is an act of faith that evidence will change minds that aren't open to it. Sometimes it works. More often it burns time you could have spent on scouts.

The qualifying questions that work aren't interrogation techniques. They're honest curiosity about fit. What are you trying to solve? What have you tried? What has to be true for this to work inside your organization? Scouts engage these seriously. Soldiers deflect or perform.

You can't convert soldiers to scouts by being more persuasive. Mindset isn't a closing problem. What you can do is identify them faster and move on.

The scouts are out there. Pipeline gets better when you stop clogging it with deals that were never deals.
