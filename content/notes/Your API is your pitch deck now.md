Pitch decks are for humans. They need narrative. Market size. Founder story. Something that earns the judgment call. The pitch deck exists to compress your case into something a human can evaluate in 20 minutes.

Agents don't do that.

When an agent selects tools at runtime, it reads your documentation, tests your endpoints, and checks whether you compose cleanly with everything else in the workflow. It doesn't read your one-pager. It doesn't watch your demo. It calls your API, sees what comes back, and decides whether to keep you.

Your API surface is your pitch deck now. And most founders haven't updated their go-to-market to match.

Two things happened simultaneously that made this true.

The first: products no longer have edges. You used to ship a defined thing, position what was inside, and sell it as a bounded object. AI agents broke that assumption. An agent discovers your API and wires it into workflows you never imagined. Surface area is emergent, not shipped. Defined at runtime by the agent, not your product team. You can't fully control what your product is anymore.

The second: agents evaluate trust through memory, not marketing. MEMORY.md accumulates through use—what worked, what didn't, what to reach for again. SOUL.md encodes values. Ad spend can't edit either file. Only reliable, composable, well-documented APIs earn the repeat call. Trust is written by the product's actual performance, not its positioning.

Put them together: your product has no fixed shape, and your pitch has no human to land on. What's left is the API itself—the quality of the documentation, the reliability of the endpoints, the depth of composability. That's what gets evaluated. That's what gets remembered.

This has a direct consequence for go-to-market.

If your API is your pitch deck, then developer experience is your sales motion. Documentation isn't a support function—it's your homepage for agents. Error handling isn't a quality concern—it's your brand voice for every failed call at 2am when no one's watching. Uptime isn't an infrastructure metric—it's your retention strategy.

The companies that win the agent era will treat DX like GTM. Not because developers are always the buyers—sometimes they are, often they're not—but because the agent's first impression happens in your API. That impression gets written to memory. Memory determines who gets chosen next time.

Your pitch deck can be polished. Your API cannot lie.

Most founders I work with are still investing in the wrong sales collateral. Beautiful decks. Sharp one-pagers. Polished demo scripts. Those things matter when the buyer is a human with a calendar. The agent era adds a second buyer—one that evaluates you continuously, silently, and without an audience.

If you're building tools in the agent layer and your developer experience is an afterthought, you don't have a sales problem. You have a pitch problem. The pitch just isn't your deck anymore.

The [GTM Map](https://gtm.shawnyeager.com) diagnostic will tell you where your go-to-market is actually breaking. For most founders building in the agent era, the break isn't where they're looking.
