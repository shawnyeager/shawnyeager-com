description: Positioning breaks when treated as a one-time deliverable instead of maintained infrastructure that messaging, sales, and targeting all depend on.
---

Every team does positioning at some point. Usually before a launch, or during a fundraise. There's a workshop, a framework document, maybe a tagline that gets approved. Someone puts "Positioning v2" in the filename.

Then the product ships. Things change. The ICP narrows based on who actually buys. Objections evolve. Competition moves.

The positioning document doesn't.

Six months later: sales is pitching one thing, marketing is saying another, the website is using the original language from the seed round, and nobody can explain why deals keep dying in the middle of the funnel. Same company, four different messages.

This happens because teams treat positioning as a deliverable instead of a dependency.

## A deliverable gets done. A dependency has to hold.

In software, a dependency is something other code relies on. If it breaks, everything downstream breaks. If it changes, everything downstream has to update. You can't ship a feature built on broken infrastructure and expect it to work. The dependency has to be right first.

Positioning is the same. It's the upstream assumption that messaging, targeting, pricing, and sales all depend on. If it's wrong, everything downstream is running on bad assumptions. Messages don't land. Targeting hits the wrong buyers. Sales inherits a pitch that doesn't work and can't figure out why.

The failure mode isn't that teams never do positioning. They do. The failure mode is treating it as a task to be checked off instead of infrastructure to be maintained.

## How it breaks

Positioning breaks in predictable ways.

It breaks when the ICP shifts. The first customers were early adopters with a specific context. The next wave has different language, different objections, different decision criteria. The original positioning was accurate for one cohort and wrong for the next.

It breaks when competition moves. Your category fills up. A new entrant takes the position you were holding. What made you distinctive last year is table stakes now. The differentiation you spent a year establishing is no longer differentiation.

It breaks when the product changes. Features land, use cases expand, what you can actually do for customers is different from what you said at launch. Positioning lags the product and nobody updates it.

None of this is unusual. All of it is expected. The companies that stay positioned treat it as a continuous process, not a project that ends.

## Why teams don't maintain it

Positioning work is uncomfortable. It requires saying no to buyers outside the ICP, cutting messages that people worked hard to write, and admitting that what shipped six months ago isn't what the market needs now.

It's also invisible. When positioning works, the downstream effects—pipeline, conversion rates, shorter sales cycles—get attributed to sales or marketing. When positioning breaks, the diagnostic instinct is to fix whatever has the numbers: change the sales process, update the ads, retrain the reps.

The dependency gets checked last, when it should be checked first.

## Run the chain before you run the plays

Before you update messaging, check positioning. Before you retrain sales, check positioning. Before you rebuild the funnel, check positioning.

If positioning isn't holding, everything downstream is fighting a dependency that doesn't resolve. You get motion, not progress.

The GTM Map at [gtm.shawnyeager.com](https://gtm.shawnyeager.com) is built around this chain. It walks through each link and surfaces where the break is—usually upstream from where the problem shows up.
