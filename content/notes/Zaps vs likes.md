description: Likes measure attention extracted; zaps measure value created — and the difference reveals whether your incentives are aligned with your users.

A like costs nothing. That's the point.

Platforms built on advertising need you to stay. Not to be happy, not to be informed—to stay. Staying means you're seeing ads. Ads are what get sold. So the platform optimizes for whatever predicts staying: engagement.

Engagement is a proxy for time on platform, which is a proxy for ad impressions, which is what the business actually needs. Likes are engagement. Comments are engagement. Outrage is engagement. The platform doesn't distinguish. It surfaces whatever generates more of it.

What gets optimized is what gets measured. What gets measured is what gets sold.

## The lie in the metric

Creators inside this system get told to chase engagement. More likes means you're resonating. More shares means the content is working.

This is partially true and mostly wrong.

Your content is working for the platform. It's generating inventory—attention that gets resold to advertisers. Whether that inventory represents genuine value is irrelevant to the business model. A post that generates outrage and a post that changes someone's mind generate identical engagement metrics. One of them is actually working.

You can't tell from the numbers which one you produced.

Likes tell you that something caught attention. They don't tell you whether that attention created value for anyone. In the extractive model, value accruing to creators or audiences is a side effect. The unit of commerce is attention, and attention gets extracted from people who didn't consent to be the product.

This isn't a design flaw. It's the design.

## What zaps measure instead

A zap is a payment. Someone sent actual money—Bitcoin, through Lightning—because what you made was worth something to them.

That's a different signal. You can't zap by reflex. The friction is intentional. A like takes a millisecond and costs nothing. A zap requires a wallet, a decision, an action. The friction removes the noise.

What remains is signal: this person valued this enough to pay for it. Not with time, which gets extracted involuntarily, but with money, which requires consent.

Value-for-value doesn't require a subscription or a paywall. It requires an honest framing: here's what I make, pay what it's worth to you. The people who value it pay. Nobody else's data is the product.

The number of zaps you receive is a noisy but honest estimate of the value you created. Likes are a measure of the platform's power to hold attention. Different systems, different incentives, different answers to the question "is this working?"

## Why this matters for builders

If you're measuring success with engagement metrics, ask who benefits from the engagement.

If engagement means users are stuck in a loop that generates your revenue but doesn't create value for them, engagement is a lagging indicator of extraction. It looks healthy until churn catches up. The extractive model degrades the thing it extracts from—this is what the ad-funded internet has done to discourse, and what engagement-optimized products do to their users.

If engagement means users are actively creating value with your product, it's a reasonable proxy. But even then—are you measuring the thing, or a shadow of the thing?

Payments are cleaner. Not perfect, not sufficient on their own. But when users pay without a wall forcing them to, that's a vote on value. Zaps are that vote.

The platforms worth building are the ones where the incentive is to make your users' lives better, because that's also what makes the business work. Aligned incentives aren't a moral choice. They're a durability choice.

Extraction is rational inside extractive systems. The way out is building a system where your interests and your users' interests point the same direction.
