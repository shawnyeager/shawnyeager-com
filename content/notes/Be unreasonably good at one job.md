The companies that scale start by being unreasonably good at one job. They pick a customer and become irreplaceable to them.

When you nail it, you stop fighting for attention. Customers find you. Word spreads because the experience is undeniable. You earn the right to expand. Then you grow---not before.

Most startups spread effort everywhere. They want better UI. Faster support. More integrations. They chase everything. Nothing compounds because nothing gets the sustained attention it needs.

Undeniable is a reality you demonstrate, not a claim you make. When it's real, you show it. People use it, they stay, they tell others. The metrics move. If you're in a meeting explaining why you're better, you're still searching.

Jobs-to-be-done gives you the framework. Most teams ask "what jobs could we do?" and end up with a list of twelve things they might be good at. Narrow it down: what is *the* job? The one the market will actually give you credit for. The intersection of what you're capable of and what customers desperately need solved---right now, not someday.

Singular focus beats scattered features.

Get it right and you have a winning MVP. Everything else---features, integrations, whatever's next---gets built around the thing that works. Get it wrong and you're shipping features nobody asked for while growth flatlines.
