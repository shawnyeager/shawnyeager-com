You've got the product. Now you need customers, revenue, and a repeatable way to get both.

But something's not working:

Positioning that makes sense to you but confuses buyers. Deals that stall and you can't figure out why. Revenue that depends on you being in every conversation. No way to tell if you're getting better or just getting lucky.

I've seen this pattern across dozens of Bitcoin and freedom tech startups. Deep in engineering and product, but flying blind on commercial fundamentals.

The Sales Readiness Score shows you where the gaps are, what's blocking scale, and what to fix first.
