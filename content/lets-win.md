Here's what I usually see: deep in engineering and product, but flying blind on commercial fundamentals. Deals stall. Revenue depends on the founder being in every conversation.

So I built a scorecard. Ten questions, five minutes. It shows you where the gaps are, what's blocking scale, and what to fix first.

Take it. If you want, we'll review your answers together and figure out where to start.
