# Your distribution problem is a product problem

You've hired a VP of Sales. Built out your GTM motion. Spent six months refining your pitch. But deals still aren't closing. Or they close slowly. Or customers churn quickly.

So you assume you need better marketing. A different sales leader. More aggressive outbound. You burn through runway trying to fix distribution while your product sits there, fundamentally unable to compete.

I've watched Bitcoin companies do this repeatedly. They build for sovereignty when customers need payments. They optimize for protocol purity when the job is to move money faster than Venmo. They add features nobody asked for while ignoring the UX gaps that kill every demo.

This isn't a GTM problem. It's a product problem. And no amount of sales expertise fixes it.

## The misdiagnosis pattern

Most founders believe their problem is distribution. They think: "If we just had better sales execution, stronger marketing, more partnerships---we'd win."

But here's what's actually happening: Customers don't want what you're selling.

Not because they don't understand Bitcoin. Not because they haven't been educated properly. Because you built something that doesn't solve the job they need done---or solves it worse than existing alternatives.

The Bitcoin-specific version looks like this: You built for people who care about monetary sovereignty. But customers are hiring your product to send money instantly. Those are different jobs. One requires understanding UTXOs and channel liquidity. The other requires tapping a button and having it work.

When you misunderstand the job, you build the wrong product. Then you wonder why GTM isn't working.

## Jobs to be done vs. what you built

People don't buy products. They hire them to do jobs.

A Lightning wallet's job isn't "let me manage channels and routing." The job is "send money to my friend right now, faster than Venmo, with lower fees." Channel management is your implementation detail. It's not the job.

When your product requires customers to care about your implementation details to use it successfully, you have a product problem. When they need to understand your architecture to accomplish their goal, you have a product problem. When the learning curve blocks them from doing the job they hired you for, you have a product problem.

This is why "we just need to educate users" is a losing strategy. You're asking people to learn your system instead of building a system that does their job. Venmo doesn't require education. It just works. Your Lightning wallet needs to do the same job, better---not the same job worse with better architecture that nobody sees.

Look at Spark's Lightning implementation. They chose trust compromises specifically because the UX gap for pure Lightning was too large. Users weren't hiring Spark to "experience trustless payments." They were hiring it to "send money instantly in their favorite app." Spark understood the job and made tradeoffs to do that job better than alternatives.

You can debate whether those tradeoffs were right. But at least Spark understood what job customers were trying to get done.

## How to diagnose product-market fit gaps

Stop talking to your happy customers. They're not representative. They're the 5% who tolerate rough edges for ideological reasons.

Talk to lost deals. Talk to churned users. Talk to people who tried your product and went back to the incumbent.

Ask them: "What job were you trying to get done?" Then listen to the gap between their answer and what your product actually does.

When prospects say "this is interesting, but..." they're telling you there's a product gap. When they say "I love the idea, just not ready yet," they mean your product doesn't do the job well enough. When they ask for features that sound like table stakes, it's because you're missing basics while optimizing for advanced stuff nobody needs yet.

The clearest signal: UX complaints that keep recurring. Not "I wish this button was blue" feedback. The structural complaints. "This is too complicated." "I don't understand what this means." "Why do I have to do all these steps?"

Those aren't UX problems. They're product-market fit problems. Your product is asking users to solve your technical challenges instead of doing their job for them.

## What "good enough to scale" actually means

Your product must win on the job customers care about first. Not eventually. Not after they understand Bitcoin. First.

If you're building Lightning payments, you need to beat Venmo at sending money instantly. Not "beat Venmo if you care about sovereignty." Actually beat Venmo on speed, cost, and ease of use. The sovereignty becomes the bonus feature---the reason to stick around after you've already won on the basics.

This is the "Sovereignty Without Sacrifice" standard. Products that are better at everything that matters to users, that happen to be more sovereign. Not products that are more sovereign but worse at everything users actually need.

Spark chose trust compromises because they understood this. The pure Lightning UX gap was too big. Users would choose Venmo over a perfectly trustless solution that was harder to use. So Spark made tradeoffs to do the job better while working toward the pure solution.

You can argue about those specific tradeoffs. But you can't argue with the principle: if your product doesn't do the job better than alternatives, scaling GTM is just burning money faster.

## What this means for your company

If you're struggling with commercial traction, stop assuming it's distribution. Ask instead:

Does our product do the customer's job better than their current solution?

Not "does it have better architecture." Not "is it more aligned with Bitcoin principles." Does it actually solve their problem better---faster, cheaper, easier, more reliably---than what they use today?

If the answer is no, or if the answer requires extensive customer education to become yes, you have product work to do before you scale GTM.

This is the hardest conversation to have with investors and boards. You're burning runway. Everyone wants revenue growth. The pressure is to hire more salespeople, spend more on marketing, push harder.

But scaling distribution for a product that isn't ready just teaches the market that your product doesn't work. You get one shot to show customers you're better. Blow it with a product that isn't ready, and you've permanently burned that relationship.

Better to acknowledge you have product work to do. Better to slow down GTM while you close the gaps. Better to ship later with a product that wins on the job customers need done.

## The honest assessment

Most Bitcoin products aren't ready to scale. They're technically impressive. Architecturally sound. Aligned with decentralization principles.

But they don't do the basic job better than centralized alternatives. They ask users to understand complexity that should be hidden. They optimize for purity over usability. They serve the 5% who already care about sovereignty instead of the 95% who just need to get something done.

You can't fix this with better sales. You fix it by building a product that does the job customers are hiring you for---and does it obviously, undeniably better than what they use today.

Only then does GTM matter. Only then can sales execution make a difference. Only then are you ready to scale.

Until then, you're just burning money trying to sell something people don't want.
