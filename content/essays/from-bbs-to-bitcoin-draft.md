# [WORKING TITLE: From BBS to Bitcoin]

I've been working on the internet for thirty years. Sales, business development, evangelism—helping companies grow, helping technology reach people. I thought I was helping build freedom. I was helping build extraction.

It started with magic. BBS era: connecting with strangers across the world, pure possibility, no business model to corrupt it. That spark never left me.

Then came the waves. Microsoft in the late nineties: evangelizing the browser, e-commerce, making transactions safe. Exodus Communications selling infrastructure while everything became about "eyeballs." Music tech promising to liberate artists, delivering extraction instead. Personal data ownership that couldn't compete with "free."

Every time, I thought this wave would be different. Every time, same outcome.

Then Bitcoin showed me what I couldn't see for three decades. There are bad actors, sure. But at the core? Broken money creating broken incentives—and I'd been optimizing within a system I couldn't see.

## Three waves, same pattern, blind each time

### Wave 1: Dotcom Boom (1997–2001)

At Microsoft, I was an Internet Evangelist on the first Internet Explorer team. Browser wars, e-commerce, B2B internet products. We were democratizing access, getting businesses across the chasm. SSL certificates, the lock icon, making people comfortable enough to type in a credit card number. It felt like building the future.

Then Exodus Communications, where I led a partnerships team building relationships with the major tech players. We hosted the biggest sites on the internet—Hotmail, Merrill Lynch, the giants. Somewhere along the way, everything became about "eyeballs." I was young, eager, somewhat naive. It felt slimy, but everyone was doing it.

Late 2001, I laid off my entire team. Exodus went into bankruptcy. Partner companies that had drive-in theaters and expensive art were gone months later. I understood it was a bubble—Greenspan's "irrational exuberance." But I didn't understand *why* it happened. Not really.

### Wave 2: Centralization & Surveillance (2004–2016)

I worked on grid computing as it became cloud—infrastructure that promised to democratize access to computing power. Instead, it paved the way for centralized SaaS, subscription fatigue, and platforms with even more control over users. Another wave, another extraction.

Meanwhile, I watched Facebook and Twitter rise with business models that actually worked: advertising. Surveillance.

The pattern was repeating, but I still didn't see the mechanism.

### Wave 3: Creator Economy (2010s–2019)

The promise was transformative—the internet freeing creators and consumers from gatekeepers. Music streaming platforms promising to help artists. Personal data companies enabling users to own their information. Real frameworks for sovereignty.

What I found instead: both captured by extractive practices. DRM, RIAA, streaming platforms extracting value from artists they claimed to liberate. And in personal data, we were up against the economics of "free"—even when explicitly building for sovereignty, we couldn't compete with ad-funded extraction.

Same pattern, different industries. That's when I started suspecting this was systemic.

### The Blindness

Three waves. Each time I thought I was working on the good version. Each time: captured by extraction.

I was optimizing within a system I couldn't see. I thought it was bad actors, poor execution, bad timing. The dotcom crash was a bubble. Surveillance capitalism was greedy founders. Creator economy was legacy industry politics. Each explanation felt sufficient.

None of them explained why it kept happening.

## What analysts see vs what I finally saw

Cory Doctorow nailed the diagnosis. His "enshittification" framework describes exactly what I witnessed: platforms start good to users while locking them in, then abuse users to serve business customers, then abuse everyone to extract maximum value.

His solution: antitrust enforcement, break up monopolies, strengthen regulation.

He's right about what happened. He's right that regulation matters.

But even brilliant analysts miss the deeper mechanism.

When I interviewed Doctorow on my podcast, his take on Bitcoin was dismissive—fixed supply means instability, it's only good for buying "shitty monkey JPEGs." What struck me wasn't the critique. It was the inconsistency. He's willing to fight for decades to make imperfect regulation work. But Bitcoin, fifteen years in with real problems being solved? Dismissed outright.

Where's "Lightning has issues, let's fix them"?

I'm not here to debate monetary theory. The point is simpler: even the sharpest critics of enshittification stop at monopoly power and regulatory capture. They don't ask what created the conditions for monopolies to form, for regulation to get captured, for extraction to become the rational choice everywhere.

That question haunted me until Bitcoin answered it.

## The mechanism: broken money

Why did every platform end up extractive? Not lack of creativity. Not evil intentions. Economics.

Fiat currency is a melting ice cube. "Target inflation" sounds benign—2% per year, barely noticeable. But it compounds into a simple mandate: extract value now, before it depreciates. High time preference gets baked into the system. "Get it while you can" becomes economically rational.

This explains every wave I lived through.

Dotcom: Cheap credit flooded the market, funded companies with no real business model. Growth at all costs. Get in, get as much as you can, get out. When the music stopped, the malinvestment was obvious. But I blamed the bubble, not the cheap money that inflated it.

Surveillance capitalism: You can't monetize value creation directly when users expect "free." Advertising works—a third party pays, users pay with attention and data. Once ad-funded, incentives align toward extraction. More engagement means more revenue. Quality becomes secondary to outrage, addiction, polarization. Extract now, worry about sustainability later.

Creator economy: Streaming platforms promised to liberate artists, then extracted from them. Personal data sovereignty couldn't compete with "free." Same pattern—whoever captures attention sells it to advertisers, because that's the only model that works when money itself is losing value.

Even the "good actors" got captured. Google's "don't be evil" met the ad business model. Facebook's "connect the world" became surveillance to sell ads. Twitter's "public square" optimized for engagement until toxicity won.

Not moral failure. Economic structure.

This is everywhere fiat touches. Real estate speculation over building. Stock buybacks over R&D. Financialization over production. Short-term extraction over long-term value creation.

The invisible hand I couldn't see for thirty years: fiat debasement drives high time preference, and high time preference makes extraction rational.

## Why I couldn't see it

I was inside the machine, optimizing within the system. Each wave felt different—dotcom versus social versus creator economy. Different technologies, different players, different promises. I didn't understand money or economics. I thought the failures were local: bad actors, poor execution, bad timing.

Each explanation felt sufficient in the moment. None of them explained why it kept happening.

When I first encountered Bitcoin, I didn't get it. "Blockchain" and "crypto" felt like shiny new tech—another wave to ride. I was briefly captured by the snake oil, the ICOs, the hype. Then somewhere in 2016, it clicked: it wasn't the tech. It was the money, stupid.

Understanding fiat debasement. Seeing high time preference everywhere once I knew to look. Realizing this is why everything becomes extraction, eventually.

Once you see it, you can't unsee it.

If you're building on the internet right now, ask yourself:

Is your business model ad-funded? Are you taking VC money optimizing for growth at all costs? Are you competing with "free" and losing? Do you think your wave is different?

If you're building on fiat incentives, you're building extraction. Whether you see it or not.

I couldn't see it for thirty years. I was inside some of the biggest waves of internet history, and the pattern was invisible to me until Bitcoin made it obvious.

You might be just as blind.

## Bitcoin revealed it

Bitcoin didn't just reveal the pattern. It offers a way out.

Native internet money changes the economic foundation. With Lightning, you can monetize value creation directly—no advertising intermediary required. Instant settlement, minimal fees, global and permissionless. Different incentives become possible.

This isn't theoretical. Podcasting 2.0 lets listeners stream sats directly to creators. Nostr clients charge for premium features instead of selling user data. Strike competes with Venmo without the extraction. The business model shifts: better product equals more usage equals revenue from service, not surveillance.

The key difference: fiat systems reward extracting now before value depreciates. Sound money lowers time preference. Build for the long term because the long term matters.

But Bitcoin doesn't automatically fix anything.

Lightning needs to work better than Visa. Nostr needs to be better than Twitter. Self-custody needs to be easier than banking. The infrastructure enables different incentives—now we have to ship products people actually choose.

This connects to what I've written before about sovereignty without sacrifice. Broken money created extraction everywhere. Bitcoin fixes the incentive layer. But we still have to win on merit, not ideology.

Regulation matters too. Antitrust constrains monopolies. Better enforcement levels the playing field. But regulation alone can't fix the incentive layer—break up an ad-funded company and you get smaller ad-funded companies with the same extraction logic.

Both are needed. Regulation cleans up the old economics. Bitcoin creates the foundation for new ones.

This time can be different. But only if we see the pattern and build accordingly.
