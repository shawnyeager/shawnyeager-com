I've been working on the internet for over thirty years. I watched the same pattern repeat across every wave---dotcom, surveillance capitalism, enshittification. Each promised to democratize something. Each ended in extraction.

For twenty years I thought the problem was execution, or regulation, or bad actors. It was simpler than that.

It was the money.

## The mechanism: broken money

Why did every platform end up extractive? The usual explanations fail.

Fiat currency is a melting ice cube. "Target inflation" sounds benign---2% per year, barely noticeable. But it compounds into a simple mandate: extract value now, before it depreciates. High time preference gets baked into the system. "Get it while you can" stops being greed. It becomes rational.

This is everywhere fiat touches. Real estate speculation. Stock buybacks over R&D. Financialization eating production. Everywhere you look, short-term extraction winning over long-term value.

The invisible hand I couldn't see for over twenty years: fiat debasement drives high time preference, and high time preference makes extraction rational.

Native internet money changes the equation. With Lightning, you can monetize value creation directly---no advertising intermediary required. Podcasting 2.0 lets listeners stream sats to creators. Nostr clients charge for premium features instead of selling user data---because they can't. Strike competes with Venmo without extraction---because their margins are rich. The business model shifts: better product equals revenue from service, not surveillance.

Fiat systems reward extracting now before value depreciates. Sound money lowers time preference. You can afford to build for the long term.

Extraction existed under the gold standard---robber barons, railroad monopolies. But fiat systematized it. Made short-term thinking the default winning strategy across every industry, every wave.[^1]

## Three waves of extraction

**Wave 1: Dotcom.** In 1998, the Fed cut rates after Long-Term Capital Management collapsed. Cheap credit flooded the market, funded companies with no real business model. Growth at all costs. Get in, get as much as you can, get out. I was there---Internet Evangelist at Microsoft, then Exodus Communications hosting the biggest sites on the internet. Somewhere along the way, everything became about "eyeballs." Late 2001, I laid off my entire team, then got the boot. Exodus went into bankruptcy. I understood it was a bubble. But I blamed the bubble, not the cheap money that inflated it.

**Wave 2: Surveillance capitalism.** You can't monetize value creation directly when users expect "free." Why do they expect free? When savings lose value, consumers chase what's free now---unwilling to pay upfront for anything they can get now. Advertising fills the gap: a third party pays, users pay with attention and data. Facebook and Twitter solved the business model problem: give away the product, sell the users. More engagement means more revenue---quality becomes secondary to outrage, addiction, polarization. Even the "good actors" got captured. Google's "don't be evil" met the ad business model. Facebook's "connect the world" became surveillance to sell ads.

**Wave 3: Enshittification.** Platforms lock users in, then abuse them to serve business customers, then abuse everyone to extract maximum value. I watched this from inside the creator economy---co-founded a music tech accelerator, then moved into personal data ownership. Streaming platforms promised to liberate artists, then extracted from them. We built real frameworks for data sovereignty---software and legal structures that actually worked. But we couldn't compete with "free." Whoever captures attention sells it to advertisers, because that's the only model that works when money itself is losing value.

The pattern accelerated when cheap money dried up. Uber took fourteen years to turn a quarterly profit. Spotify took seventeen to post a profitable year. When rates rose in 2022, Netflix added ads, Spotify cut staff and raised prices, streaming services consolidated. The extraction that ZIRP subsidized came due.

Three waves. Same mechanism. I thought the failures were local: bad actors, poor execution, bad timing. Each explanation felt sufficient. Until it didn't.

## Where sharp critics stop

Cory Doctorow nailed the diagnosis. His "enshittification" framework describes exactly what I witnessed: platforms start good to users while locking them in, then abuse users to serve business customers, then abuse everyone to extract maximum value.

His solution: antitrust enforcement, break up monopolies, strengthen regulation, mandate interoperability.

He's right about what happened. These things matter.

But this strain of thinking---diagnose monopoly power, prescribe antitrust---stops one layer short.

When I interviewed Doctorow on my podcast, I asked about protocols over platforms. If platforms inevitably enshittify, what about permissionless protocols that bypass them entirely? He pivoted. Protocols are great---for everything except money. For money, he insists it's a platform problem, not a protocol problem. Bitcoin? "The shittiest money imaginable." Only good for buying "shitty monkey JPEGs."

The critique didn't bother me. The asymmetry did.

Doctorow is willing to fight for decades to make imperfect regulation work. Regulators get captured? Keep fighting. It took 35 years to break up AT&T? Worth it. Antitrust enforcement is slow and captured and often fails? Still the right approach.

But Bitcoin, sixteen years in with real problems being solved? Dismissed outright.

Where's "Lightning has problems, let's fix them"?

Even the sharpest critics of extraction stop at monopoly power and regulatory capture. They ask *how* platforms become extractive, but not *why* extraction becomes the rational choice everywhere, across every industry, every wave, every decade.

## To builders

For years, I watched smart people fight extraction with the wrong tools---content moderation, legislation, more enlightened executives, open standards. All worth doing, but none of them address why extraction becomes rational in the first place.

The leverage is in the money layer.

Regulation matters. Antitrust constrains monopolies. Interoperability creates escape routes. Better enforcement levels the playing field. But regulation alone can't fix the root cause---break up an ad-funded company and you get smaller ad-funded companies running the same extraction logic. "This time is different" is the oldest delusion in financial history.[^2]

My message to builders---Bitcoin builders and everyone else:

Stop treating symptoms. Regulation can constrain bad behavior and interop can create exits. But neither fixes why extraction becomes the rational choice. Only fixing the money does that.

If you're building on the internet right now, ask yourself: Is your business model ad-funded or VC-subsidized? Competing with "free" and losing? If you're building on fiat incentives, you're building extraction. Whether you see it or not.

I don't have proof at scale. The Bitcoin-native examples are small. We won't know if the thesis holds until companies built on sound money face the same pressures that captured Google and Facebook. That test is coming.

For most of my career, there was no solution. Bitcoin didn't exist. Now it does. Sixteen years in, the pattern is visible---if you're willing to look.
