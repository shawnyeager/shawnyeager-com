I've been working on the internet for over thirty years. Sales, business development, evangelism--helping companies grow, helping technology reach people. There were real wins along the way. Real value created. But looking back, I see a pattern I missed for most of my career: my efforts, like most of ours, kept getting captured by something I didn't understand.

It started with magic. The BBS era: connecting with people far flung across the world, pure possibility, no "business model" to corrupt it. That spark never left me.

That spark is what pulled me into tech professionally. I wanted to help build the thing that had shown me what was possible.

Then came the waves. Every one of them promised more of that magic. Every one of them went somewhere else.

Then Bitcoin showed me what I missed for over 20 years. It wasn't bad actors or poor execution or regulatory failure. It was simpler than that.

It was the money.

## Three waves, same pattern, blind each time

### Wave 1: Dotcom Boom

At Microsoft, I was an Internet Evangelist (actual title) on the Internet Explorer team. Browser wars, e-commerce, internet infrastructure products. We were democratizing access, getting businesses across the chasm. Getting to the lock icon, making people comfortable enough to type in a credit card number. It felt like building the future. (Never mind that the DOJ was suing us. The product was free--early signs of what that would come to mean.)

Then Exodus Communications, where I led a team building relationships with the major tech players. We hosted the biggest sites on the internet--from Hotmail to Merrill Lynch, the giants. Somewhere along the way, everything became about "eyeballs." I was young, eager, somewhat naive. It felt a little seedy, but everyone was doing it.

Late 2001, I laid off my entire team, then got the boot. Exodus went into bankruptcy. Startups I worked with had drive-in theaters on the rooftop and millions of dollars of art in the lobbies were gone months later. I understood it was a bubble--Greenspan's "irrational exuberance." But I didn't understand *why* it happened. Not really.

### Wave 2: Centralization & Surveillance

I worked on grid computing which became cloud--infrastructure that promised to democratize access to computing power. And it did, for a while. Startups could spin up servers without buying hardware. Small teams could build at scale. Real value.

But the same infrastructure enabled something else: centralized platforms with unprecedented control over users. SaaS meant you never owned the software. Cloud meant your data lived on someone else's servers. Better tools, tighter lock-in.

Meanwhile, Facebook and Twitter were solving the business model problem. Turns out you can give away the product if you sell the users. Advertising worked. Surveillance worked better.

The pattern was repeating, but I still didn't see the underlying mechanism.

### Wave 3: Creator Economy & Data Sovereignty

The promise: the internet would let people own what they create. Musicians would escape the labels. Users would control their own data. I worked on both sides of this--co-founded a music tech accelerator, worked with over a hundred startups, VCs, labels, and publishers. Then moved into personal data ownership.

What I found: extraction everywhere. Digital Rights Management, nonstop lawfare from RIAA, streaming platforms extracting value from artists they claimed to liberate. And in personal data, we built real frameworks for sovereignty--software and legal structures that actually worked. But we couldn't compete with "free." When the alternative is ad-funded and costs nothing, ownership is a tough sell.

Same pattern, different industries. That's when I started suspecting this was systemic.

### The Blind Spot

Three waves. I thought I understood what was happening. I had the wrong frame.

I was optimizing within a system I couldn't see. Was dotcom a bubble? Yes. Were founders greedy? Some. Was legacy politics a factor? Sure. But those weren't the foundational problem.

None of them explained why it kept happening.

## What activists and analysts see vs what I finally saw

Cory Doctorow nailed the diagnosis. His "enshittification" framework describes exactly what I witnessed: platforms start good to users while locking them in, then abuse users to serve business customers, then abuse everyone to extract maximum value.

His solution: antitrust enforcement, break up monopolies, strengthen regulation, mandate interoperability.

He's right about what happened, and he's right that these things matter.

But this strain of thinking--diagnose monopoly power, prescribe antitrust--stops one layer short.

When I interviewed Doctorow on my podcast, his take on Bitcoin was dismissive. Fixed supply means instability. It's only good for buying "shitty monkey JPEGs." What struck me wasn't the critique itself. It was the asymmetry. He's willing to fight for decades to make imperfect regulation work. Regulators get captured? Keep fighting. Antitrust takes 69 years to break up AT&T? Worth it. But Bitcoin, fifteen years in with real problems being solved? Dismissed outright.

Where's "Lightning has problems, let's fix them"?

Even the sharpest critics of extraction stop at monopoly power and regulatory capture. They ask *how* platforms become extractive. They don't ask *why* extraction becomes the rational choice everywhere, across every industry, every wave, every decade.

What creates the conditions for monopolies to form? For regulation to get captured? For extraction to become not just possible but economically optimal?

That question haunted me until Bitcoin answered it.

## The mechanism: broken money

Why did every platform end up extractive? It wasn't lack of creativity or evil intentions or insufficient regulation.

It's the money, stupid.

Fiat currency is a melting ice cube. "Target inflation" sounds benign--2% per year, barely noticeable. But it compounds into a simple mandate: extract value now, before it depreciates. High time preference gets baked into the system. "Get it while you can" stops being greed. It becomes rational.

This explains every wave I lived through.

Dotcom: Cheap credit flooded the market, funded companies with no real business model. Growth at all costs. Get in, get as much as you can, get out. When the music stopped, the malinvestment was obvious. But I blamed the bubble, not the cheap money that inflated it.

Surveillance capitalism: You can't monetize value creation directly when users expect "free." Advertising works--a third party pays, users pay with attention and data. Once ad-funded, incentives align toward extraction. More engagement means more revenue. Quality becomes secondary to outrage, addiction, polarization. Extract now, worry about sustainability later.

Creator economy: Streaming platforms promised to liberate artists, then extracted from them. Personal data sovereignty couldn't compete with "free." Same pattern--whoever captures attention sells it to advertisers, because that's the only model that works when money itself is losing value.

Even the "good actors" got captured. Google's "don't be evil" met the ad business model. Facebook's "connect the world" became surveillance to sell ads. Twitter's "public square" optimized for engagement until angst and outrage won.

Not moral failure. Economic structure.

I'm not claiming money is the only variable. Extraction existed under the gold standard--robber barons, railroad monopolies, Standard Oil. Network effects and power concentration predate fiat. But fiat accelerates and systematizes extraction. It makes short-term thinking the default winning strategy. Money isn't *the* cause. It's the underappreciated variable that explains why extraction became the norm rather than the exception.

This is everywhere fiat touches. Real estate speculation instead of building. Stock buybacks instead of R&D. Financialization eating production. Everywhere you look, short-term extraction winning over long-term value.

The invisible hand I couldn't see for over twenty years: fiat debasement drives high time preference, and high time preference makes extraction rational.

## Why I couldn't see it

I was inside the machine, optimizing within the system. Each wave felt different--dotcom versus social versus creator economy. Different tech, different players, same outcome. I didn't understand money or economics. I thought the failures were local: bad actors, poor execution, bad timing.

Each explanation felt sufficient in the moment. None of them explained why it kept happening.

When I first encountered Bitcoin, I didn't get it. "Blockchain" and "crypto" felt like shiny new tech--another wave to ride. I was briefly captured by the snake oil, the ICOs, the hype. Then somewhere in 2016, it clicked: it wasn't the tech. It was the money, stupid.

Fiat debasement. High time preference. Once I knew what to look for, I saw it everywhere.

If you're building on the internet right now, ask yourself:

Is your business model ad-funded? Taking VC money that demands growth at all costs? Competing with "free" and losing?

If you're building on fiat incentives, you're building extraction. Whether you see it or not.

## Where the leverage actually is

Bitcoin showed me where the leverage is.

For years, I watched smart people fight extraction with the wrong tools--content moderation, legislation, more enlightened executives, open standards. All worth doing. None of them address why extraction becomes rational in the first place.

The leverage is in the money layer.

Native internet money changes the economic foundation. With Lightning, you can monetize value creation directly--no advertising intermediary required. Podcasting 2.0 lets listeners stream sats to creators. Nostr clients charge for premium features instead of selling user data--because they can't. Strike competes with Venmo without extraction. The business model shifts: better product equals revenue from service, not surveillance.

Fiat systems reward extracting now before value depreciates. Sound money lowers time preference. You can afford to build for the long term.

But Bitcoin doesn't automatically fix anything.

Look at FTX, Celsius, the parade of Bitcoin-adjacent extraction. Sound money didn't stop fraud or rent-seeking. Bitcoin changes the incentive layer, not human nature. Extraction in a Bitcoin economy is fighting the current. In fiat, you're floating downstream.

Lightning needs to beat Visa. Self-custody needs to be easier than banking. The infrastructure enables different incentives--now we have to ship products people actually choose.

[Sovereignty without sacrifice](/essays/sovereignty-without-sacrifice/): Bitcoin fixes the incentive layer. We still have to win on merit.

Regulation matters too. Antitrust constrains monopolies, interoperability creates escape routes, and better enforcement levels the playing field. But regulation alone can't fix the root cause--break up an ad-funded company and you get smaller ad-funded companies running the same extraction logic.

So here's my message to builders--Bitcoin builders and everyone else:

Stop treating symptoms. Regulation can constrain bad behavior. Interop can create exits. But neither fixes why extraction becomes the rational choice. Only fixing the money does that.

I've barely scratched the surface here. The mechanism runs deeper than one essay can cover. But you don't need the full theory to start.

Start with a question: *What if the money were fixed?*

Every time you see extraction--ad-funded platforms, VC-subsidized growth, subscription fatigue, enshittification--ask what would change if the money weren't melting. If saving were rational. If long-term thinking paid off.

Some problems go away. Others stick around but look different. The exercise isn't to make Bitcoin the answer to everything. It's to see where broken money is the invisible variable you've been ignoring.

I don't have proof at scale. The Bitcoin-native examples are small. We won't know if the thesis holds until companies built on sound money face the same pressures that captured Google and Facebook. That test is coming.

For most of my career, there was no solution. Bitcoin didn't exist. Now it does. Sixteen years in, the pattern is visible--if you're willing to look.
