summary: "Most first sales hires fail not because of the rep. They fail because positioning was never solved and the rep walked into fog instead of a playbook. Fix the foundation first—ICP, value prop, reproducible close—then hire someone to run it."
---

The hire looked good on paper. Track record at a company you'd heard of. They'd closed enterprise. References checked out. In the interview they could talk about process, pipeline hygiene, qualification. They had the energy.

Six months later, deals were dying in the middle of the funnel. You watched the CRM. Activity was there—calls, demos, follow-ups. Nothing was closing. You extended the ramp. You started sitting in on calls. Eventually you let them go and called it a fit issue.

It wasn't a fit issue.

## What they walked into

When a sales rep joins a company that has solved positioning, their job is tractable. They learn the ICP. They learn the value prop. They learn where deals tend to get stuck and what language moves them. The founder hands them a playbook built from real closes. The rep runs it, refines it, makes it faster.

When a sales rep joins a company that hasn't solved positioning, something else happens. They walk into fog. Nobody can explain clearly who buys, why they buy, or what the product does for the person writing the check. The rep has to figure it out. Some try—they reverse-engineer the winning deals, build their own pitch. Others wing it. Both options are bad. Neither is the rep's fault.

Your first hire walked into fog. They did what people do in fog: they guessed.

## The dependency chain

There's a sequence that makes revenue work. It looks like this: you understand the market. You know who buys, what triggers a purchase, what language they use to describe the problem. From that you build positioning—a clear, specific case for why your product is the right answer for that buyer right now. From positioning you build messaging. From messaging you build a repeatable sales motion. Then you hire someone to run the motion.

Break a link and everything downstream fails.

Most founders skip straight to the hire. Revenue is slow, the board wants a pipeline number, and hiring a rep is doing something. It signals progress. The problem is upstream, but the hire is concrete and the upstream problem is invisible.

I've watched founders cycle through three sales hires in eighteen months, each one carrying the diagnosis from the last: bad rep, wrong culture fit, not a hunter. Each hire inherited the same broken foundation. Each one failed the same way. The company ended up with bad data about sales talent and no new information about the actual constraint.

## What broke first

When the hire fails, trace it back.

Ask what their pitch sounded like three months in. Did it match yours? In most cases it diverges significantly—because nobody gave them a working pitch to start with. They invented one. That's not hustle. That's a sign the pitch was never nailed down.

Ask how deals died. Were you losing to competitors or to nothing? Losing to a competitor means the buyer understood you well enough to compare. That's a positioning sharpness problem—fixable. Losing to nothing—"let's revisit next quarter," "we're going to table this," "went dark after the demo"—means the buyer never understood enough to decide. They didn't choose someone else. They chose inaction. That's a positioning clarity problem, and it lives further upstream.

Ask whether champions could sell it internally. The rep gets the champion excited. The champion takes it to their boss. Their boss asks what it does. The champion can't explain it. The deal dies in the approval chain, not in the sales call. The rep reports "lost to internal budget concerns." What actually happened: the value prop didn't survive one retelling.

Positioning failed. The rep inherited the failure.

## The silence around the hire

Why doesn't anyone name this?

Because positioning isn't in the CRM. Lost deals are. Activity is. Conversion rates are. When you're looking for the problem, you go where the data is. Sales has the data. So sales looks like the problem.

Positioning doesn't have a dashboard. It doesn't have a number. It lives in conversations—in the confusion during demos, in the silence before "we'll think about it." It's invisible until you know how to look.

There's also the cognitive load of the hire itself. You've made a bet: compensation, equity, six months of runway. Admitting the real problem means admitting you gave that person an impossible job. That's harder to sit with than "they weren't the right fit."

So the pattern repeats. New hire, same fog, same outcome.

## What founders skip

The founders who get this right do something counterintuitive: they sell before they hire. Not because they love selling. Usually because they can't afford a rep yet. But the constraint becomes an advantage.

They close the first customers themselves. They learn who actually buys and why. They hear the objections. They find the language that moves a deal forward. They develop a close rate on a specific ICP. They build something repeatable—rough, but real.

Then they hire.

The hire doesn't walk into fog. They walk into a playbook. A rough one, probably. But it has real evidence behind it: these types of buyers convert, here's the pitch that works, here's where deals die and what to say when they do. The rep can run and refine, not reinvent.

The signal that it's time to hire: you've closed ten or fifteen deals yourself, you understand the pattern, and you're confident the constraint is now capacity. Not clarity. Capacity.

If the constraint is still clarity—if you still can't say with confidence who you're targeting, what you're saying, and why it works—a rep will spend their ramp figuring that out. You'll pay for the education. You won't get the pipeline.

## What has to exist first

Before the hire, four things need to be in place.

A specific ICP. Not a demographic description. A description of the buyer who has the problem, has the budget, has the authority, and has the urgency to buy now. If you find yourself defining ICP with adjectives like "forward-thinking" or "strategic," start over.

A value prop those buyers recognize. Test it: ask three recent buyers to explain what your product does for them. If the answers are inconsistent, positioning isn't set. Sales training won't fix inconsistent positioning.

A reproducible close. Some deals close and you know why. Others close and you got lucky. One of these is a foundation. The other is noise. You need enough reps on enough deals to distinguish them.

A defined sales motion. Sequence of steps, decision criteria at each stage, understanding of what kills deals and when. Not a CRM template. Actual pattern knowledge from actual sales.

When all four of these exist, the hire has a fair shot. Without them, the hire is the first person you've put in charge of figuring out what you haven't figured out. That's not a sales job. It's market discovery. And it's probably not in their job description.

## What a good hire looks like

When the foundation holds, the sales hire's job gets specific: find more buyers who match the ICP, run the proven motion, close deals, and surface what's changing so positioning can stay current.

Reps who succeed here share something: they don't have to become experts in the product to be effective. The positioning has done the heavy lifting. They're running a cleared path. Execution is still hard. Execution on a cleared path is at least possible.

The rep who failed in the first version of this story? Often the exact same person who would have succeeded with a working foundation under them. Same talent. Different outcome. The variable wasn't them.

## The actual question

When revenue isn't working and the instinct is to hire or replace a rep, ask first: what did they walk into?

If the answer involves any of these—unclear ICP, inconsistent messaging, no documented close rate, no real playbook—the problem isn't in sales. It's upstream. And no amount of hiring will fix an upstream problem by working on the downstream symptom.

Fix positioning first. Then hire.

Before you do either, it helps to know where the chain is actually broken. The GTM Map at [gtm.shawnyeager.com](https://gtm.shawnyeager.com) is a diagnostic built around this dependency chain. It surfaces where the constraint actually lives. Worth running before you make the next hire—or before you blame the last one.
