{{/*
  Empty fallback for implicit sections from content adapter.

  IMPORTANT: Do NOT use {{ define "main" }} here!

  The V4V content adapter creates pages at /{essay-slug}/v4v/ which causes
  Hugo to create implicit parent sections at /{essay-slug}/. These implicit
  sections share URLs with essay pages.

  By not defining any blocks, this template produces empty output, allowing
  the essay page (which uses single.html with baseof.html) to take precedence.
